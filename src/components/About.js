        Hello my name is Dara and I am the junior frontend developer. I love
        coding so much , when i am writing the code i forget about everything.
        We with my brother , who is the senior fullstack developer like work
        together and he help me a lot with my coding. I like his strategy he can
        tell me the tips, but never code instead me. And I going to become
        better developer then he. This is my goal life at first five years.
